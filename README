=  Description: =
==================
I divided the project to function this way:
the first 3 functions - check_input_args, read_wordlist_file and read_matrix_file i did as
asked and did not divide them.
the next function- find_words_in_matrix i divided to the following function:
    count_word_in_matrix- that counts how many times a word appear in a string.
    turn_matrix_diagonal_down- that takes every diagonal in the matrix and turns it into a row.
    matrix_up_side_down- that turns the orders of the matrix rows- the first row will be the
    last and so on.
    direction_r, direction_l, direction_d, direction_u, direction_y, direction_x, direction_w,
    direction_z- all those functions search for words in the matrix in the direction of their name
    using the functions above.
    create_dictionary- that create a dictionary containing all the words in the list each word
    points to the value 0.
    word_in_matrix_dictionary- that creates a list of all the words that appeared in the matrix.
    using all those functions i built the function find_words_in_matrix.
the function write_output_file i did as asked, and the main function which i called main_game.

check_count_word_in_matrix- A function that tests the function count_word_in_matrix from
    wordsearch- checks 3 different inputs and return True if the function works and False
    otherwise.
    the inputs- ("bee", "ebbeeb", counter)- the word appears only once and and the same
                letters appears many times in the string.
                ("dad", "dadadad", counter)- the word appears 3 times in the string.
                ("pepper", "ppepperppepper", counter)- the word appears 2 times and and the
                same letters appears many times in the string.
